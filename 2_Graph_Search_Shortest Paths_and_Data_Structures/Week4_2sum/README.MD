# 2 Sum

## Overview

The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm covered in this week's lectures.

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the $i^{th}$ row of the file specifying the $i^{th}$ entry of the array.

Your task is to compute the number of target values $t$ in the interval _[-10000,10000]_ (inclusive) such that there are _distinct_ numbers $x$, $y$ in the input file that satisfy $x+y=t$. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)

Write your numeric answer (an integer between 0 and 20001) in the space provided.


### Execution steps

To run and test it out for yourself, run the batch file 
```
run_2sum.bat
```

### Assumptions
There are no assumptions made within the code wrt the size of input file.
